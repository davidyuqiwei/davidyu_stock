# ## The weather dataset
# This tutorial uses a [weather time series dataset](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/wetter/) recorded by the [Max-Planck-Institute for Biogeochemistry](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/index.php/Main/HomePage).
# 
# This dataset contains 14 different features such as air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity. These were collected every 10 minutes, beginning in 2003. For efficiency, you will use only the data collected between 2009 and 2016. This section of the dataset was prepared by Fran√ßois Chollet for his book [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python).

# As you can see above, an observation is recorded every 10 mintues. This means that, for a single hour, you will have 6 observations. Similarly, a single day will contain 144 (6x24) observations. 
# 
# Given a specific time, let's say you want to predict the temperature 6 hours in the future. In order to make this prediction, you choose to use 5 days of observations. Thus, you would create a window containing the last 720(5x144) observations to train the model. Many such configurations are possible, making this dataset a good one to experiment with.
# 
# The function below returns the above described windows of time for the model to train on. The parameter `history_size` is the size of the past window of information. The `target_size` is how far in the future does the model need to learn to predict. The `target_size` is the label that needs to be predicted.

# ### Baseline
# Before proceeding to train a model, let's first set a simple baseline. Given an input point, the baseline method looks at all the history and predicts the next point to be the average of the last 20 observations.

# Let's see if you can beat this baseline using a recurrent neural network.

# ### Recurrent neural network
# 
# A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of neural network well-suited to time series data. RNNs process a time series step-by-step, maintaining an internal state summarizing the information they've seen so far. For more details, read the [RNN tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/sequences/recurrent). In this tutorial, you will use a specialized RNN layer called Long Short Term Memory ([LSTM](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM))
# 
# Let's now use `tf.data` to shuffle, batch, and cache the dataset.

# Let's make a sample prediction, to check the output of the model. 

# In[ ]:


for x, y in val_univariate.take(1):
    print(simple_lstm_model.predict(x).shape)


# Let's train the model now. Due to the large size of the dataset, in the interest of saving time, each epoch will only run for 200 steps, instead of the complete training data as normally done.

# In[ ]:

EPOCHS = 10

                      steps_per_epoch=EVALUATION_INTERVAL,
                      validation_data=val_univariate, validation_steps=50)


# #### Predict using the simple LSTM model
# Now that you have trained your simple LSTM, let's try and make a few predictions.

  plot.show()


# This looks better than the baseline. Now that you have seen the basics, let's move on to part two, where you will work with a multivariate time series.

# ## Part 2: Forecast a multivariate time series

# The original dataset contains fourteen features. For simplicity, this section considers only three of the original fourteen. The features used are air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and air density. 
# 
# To use more features, add their names to this list.

# In[ ]:

# In[ ]:


features = df[features_considered]
features.index = df['Date Time']

# Let's have a look at how each of these features vary across time.

# ### Single step model
# In a single step setup, the model learns to predict a single point in the future based on some history provided.
# 
# The below function performs the same windowing task as below, however, here it samples the past observation based on the step size given.

# In this tutorial, the network is shown data from the last five (5) days, i.e. 720 observations that are sampled every hour. The sampling is done every one hour since a drastic change is not expected within 60 minutes. Thus, 120 observation represent history of the last five days.  For the single step prediction model, the label for a datapoint is the temperature 12 hours into the future. In order to create a label for this, the temperature after 72(12*6) observations is used.

# #### Predict a single step future
# Now that the model is trained, let's make a few sample predictions. The model is given the history of three features over the past five days sampled every hour (120 data-points), since the goal is to predict the temperature, the plot only displays the past temperature. The prediction is made one day into the future (hence the gap between the history and prediction).

  plot.show()


# ### Multi-Step model
# In a multi-step prediction model, given a past history, the model needs to learn to predict a range of future values. Thus, unlike a single step model, where only a single future point is predicted, a multi-step model predict a sequence of the future.
# 
# For the multi-step model, the training data again consists of recordings over the past five days sampled every hour. However, here, the model needs to learn to predict the temperature for the next 12 hours. Since an obversation is taken every 10 minutes, the output is 72 predictions. For this task, the dataset needs to be prepared accordingly, thus the first step is just to create it again, but with a different target window.

# This tutorial was a quick introduction to time series forecasting using an RNN. You may now try to predict the stock market and become a billionaire.
# 
# In addition, you may also write a generator to yield data (instead of the uni/multivariate_data function), which would be more memory efficient. You may also check out this [time series windowing](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data#time_series_windowing) guide and use it in this tutorial.
